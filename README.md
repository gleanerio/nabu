# Nabu

## About

Nabu's main goal is to load/synchronize a collection of RDF graphs (for example JSON-LD document) in an 
object store (minio, S3, etc.) into a graph database/triplestore.   It's core logic can also be extended to load 
graphs into other programs.
  
Further information can be found in the [documentation directory](./docs/README.md).
