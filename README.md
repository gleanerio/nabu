# Nabu

## About

Nabu is a program for loading data graphs into triple-stores.  Its main goal is to synchronize a collection
of RDF graphs (for example JSON-LD document) in an object store (minio, S3, etc.) into a
graph database/triplestore like blazegraph or jena.
  
Further information can be found in the [documentation directory](./docs/README.md).
